## Description
This is the demo of a proposed website for the Virginia Masters Swim Team (VMST), the largest adult swim team in Virginia. VMST is a member club of [US Masters Swimming](https://www.usms.org) (USMS), a national nonprofit adult swimming organization consisting of approximately 60,000 members.

The 300 members of VMST are geographically spread throughout the state and beyond; they even include two international members (one in Australia, one in Great Britain)! As one might imagine, team communication is a challenge; moreover, USMS policy prohibits the sharing of emails.

The primary purpose of this website is to facilitate communication between VMST leadership and members.

## Deployment
The demo website is [deployed on Render](https://vmst-website.onrender.com):

<https://vmst-website.onrender.com>

If VMST team leadership adopts this website we will eventually procure a domain name, which will be published here.

## Use
A screenshot of the home page is shown below.

Visitors to the website (and prospective VMST members) can browse most of the website. If you wish to sign up for an account click the "Login" button where you will be prompted for your first and last names, and email and a password. The email is your username and must be unique among all registered users.

An Account page where you can manage your communication preferences and change your email will be added to the website shortly. Users will also shortly gain the ability to comment on posts.

There are three additional types of users beyond the basic. Users may request these enhanced roles, subject to approval by team leadership.

- team leaders, consisting of the VMST President, Vice-President, and Secretary. Only team leaders can create new posts. Any visitor or user may contact team leaders using the "Contact" page.
- coaches of workout groups. Workout groups are official VMST sub-groups that usually all practice in the same pool. Coaches can view their roster and communicate with their workout group members.
- website administrators for tasks such as comment moderation, resetting passwords, and website maintenance.
- the Virginia LMSC Membership Coordinator (email: VAMembership@usms.org) is responsible for updating the website's USMS membership database so that current emails of all VMST members can be used for communication. There should be only one user with this role, and they will need to update the membership data routinely, roughly every 1-2 weeks and on request of team leadership.

When leaders, coaches, website admins, or the Membership Coordinator log into the website they will have additional capabilities available to them through their Account Page or other pages that appear in the Navigation buttons.
